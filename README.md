# MasterServer

### What is this
MasterServer cominucate to the Database and enstablish a connection to it, then it sends the connection
back to the Submodules (like PlayerSpy,QueryReport2).

This allows to control all modules and database connection in just one program rather than have multiple
windows for each submodule.

### Setting up
See [the wiki](https://github.com/GameProgressive/MasterServer/wiki) for information.
